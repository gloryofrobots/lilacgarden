Lilypond export test
====================

Run the test with ./lilypond_export_test

It loads .rg files from data/examples, then exports to foo_out.ly (in the builddir),
and compares with foo.ly in baseline (which is the expected value).

In case of a test failure
-------------------------

The test will show only the first difference.

To see the full diff, run this from the build dir:
$ diff ../../../test/lilypond/baseline/foo.ly foo_out.ly

If the new file is correct:
$ cp foo_out.ly ../../../test/lilypond/baseline/foo.ly

If the new file is incorrect, fix the regression in the code :)

To regenerate the full baseline
-------------------------------

* Delete all files from baseline/*.ly
* Run the test
* Move all files from builddir to baseline

To add a new testcase
---------------------

* Commit the .rg file in data/examples.
* Add one line in the cpp file, in testExamples_data()
* Run the test, it will fail, but it will leave foo.ly behind in the builddir, after checking that it compiles with `lilypond`.
* Copy foo.ly from the builddir to ../../../test/lilypond/baseline/, and add it to SVN.
* Run the test again

Checking the baseline compiles
------------------------------

$ ./check_all_files.sh

This will generate a .ps file per file in baseline/*.ly, in baseline/tmp/.

You can open these files to check how things look like visually.
