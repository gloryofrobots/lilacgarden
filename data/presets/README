This directory contains the source for the instrument definition presets.

I am maintaining it in plain text "conf file" format for ease of editing.  If
you make changes to presets-editable.conf, you must generate a new presets.xml
by running

  ./regenerate-presets

After generating the file, go to the main rosegarden/ directory and run

  make ts

in order to update the translations with your changes.  They will appear in the
.ts files for the respective languages, and will appear in the GUI in context.
This method replaces the old presets-editable.XX.conf method and the old
presets-XX.xml files.
